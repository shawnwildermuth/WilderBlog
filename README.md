# WilderBlog

### **Archived Project**

I am no longer using this for my blog, but feel free to use it as the basis of yours. I've moved to a static site generator (@11ty). You can see that repo here:

Project Status: Archived

I re-wrote my blog using a new stack of web technologies including:

 - .NET 5
 - ASP.NET Core 5
 - Entity Framework Core 5
 - Vue
 - Bootstrap 4 
 - Azure Websites (Docker)
 - Azure Blob Storage
 
The project wasn't build to be a blog engine or a easy to re-use for your own blog. It doesn't mean you can't use it for that. Feel free to fork the project, but that wasn't a design goal. 

The current project is built with many pre-release technologies so that the code-base will change a lot as these technologies get closer to release. 

See my blog entry (and the live site) for more information on how and why I built it:
