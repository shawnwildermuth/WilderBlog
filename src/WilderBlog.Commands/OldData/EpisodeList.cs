From there he spent a decade at NuMega Technologies, working on seminal, award-winning products like BoundsChecker and SoftIce. Next was a seven year stint at Microsoft where he worked on the Visual Studio debugger & profiler teams, Red Dog (now known as Azure), and Hyper-V. He currently works at Skytap, a cloud computing company. Along the way, he wrote several books on Windows internals, as well as numerous articles and columns for magazines just as MSJ/MSDN, PC Magazine, and Byte.
